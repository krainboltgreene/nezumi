It's collection of behavior is meant to be included in a project's classes and modules.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing\r\n=====\r\n\r\nTo start using `shogun` you'll need to have these classes defined:\r\n\r\n  * **Endpoint**, routes all request to the right control\r\n  * **Control**, which contains the process the request is made\r\n  * **Normalizer**, which cleans/sanitizes incoming data\r\n  * **Validators**, a object that determines the validity of incoming data\r\n  * **Model**, which persists, looks up, or changes the database\r\n  * **Presenter**, which decorates the model\r\n  * **Denormalizer**, manages and formats the outgoing data.\r\n\r\nEach of these will probably be scoped to the resource, ie: You'll have a `Account::Create::Control` and `Account::Presenter`.\r\n\r\nEach project will also need a `Server` class which mounts onto Rack. Look to each of the pieces documentation to learn more about what you can change.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n==========\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem \"shogun\", \"~> 4.0\"\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself with:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install shogun\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\n  1. Fork it\r\n  2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n  3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n  4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n  5. Create new Pull Request\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=========\r\n\r\n  - 6.4.2:\r\n    - Still had problems with order of loading\r\n  - 6.4.1:\r\n    * The order of the env variables made a difference, now it comes first\r\n  - 6.4.0:\r\n    * Now environment variables will be pulled and required with the console command\r\n  - 6.3.0..6.1.1: ???\r\n  - 6.1.0:\r\n    * Created classes and a structure for the different bin commands\r\n    * Created a scaffolding system using architecture\r\n  - 6.0.0:\r\n    * Adding more tests for validators\r\n    * Renaming the \"out\" method for validators to make more sense\r\n  - 5.0.0: We \"skipped\" this version by accident.\r\n  - 4.0.1:\r\n    * We forgot to provide an private interface for the includes list.\r\n  - 4.0.0:\r\n    * ... So we totally misunderstood how `links` and `linked` keys works in JSONAPI. We've rectifid the issue and now it's a little more robust.\r\n  - 3.4.0:\r\n    * Same as 3.3.0, accidentally released as 3.4.0.\r\n  - 3.3.0:\r\n    * We no longer enforce referrer host sameness, preventing browser clients from using the API.\r\n  - 3.2.0:\r\n    * Opening an interface for defining the HTTP Origin Protection whitelist.\r\n  - 3.1.0:\r\n    * `Presenters` now responds to all `Enumerable` functions\r\n    * The `Presenter` and `Presenters` classes now knows how to handle included associations\r\n    * We now log request and response information on `DEBUG` mode\r\n  - 3.0.0:\r\n    * [BREAKING]: Moving from constants to private methods, especially for namespace\r\n  - 2.1.1:\r\n    * Reverting the ordering of the ActiveRecord related middleware, since it causes a big body bug.\r\n  - 2.1.0:\r\n    * Reorganizing the rack to avoid bad requests taking up resources\r\n    * Adding CORS support for browser clients\r\n    * Adding explicit rack requirement, because ruby :|\r\n  - 2.0.0:\r\n    * [BREAKING]: Getting rid of gems we don't care about\r\n    * Adding some tests to a few classes\r\n    * Adding some real documentation (and logo!)\r\n  - 1.0.0:\r\n    * Initial release\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene\r\n\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
