`shogun` is a Ruby HTTP API framework, architecture, and set of best practices  rolled into a core package. It's collection of behavior is meant to be included in a project's classes and modules.


Using
=====

To start using `shogun` you'll need to have these classes defined:

  * **Endpoint**, routes all request to the right control
  * **Control**, which contains the process the request is made
  * **Normalizer**, which cleans/sanitizes incoming data
  * **Validators**, a object that determines the validity of incoming data
  * **Model**, which persists, looks up, or changes the database
  * **Presenter**, which decorates the model
  * **Denormalizer**, manages and formats the outgoing data.

Each of these will probably be scoped to the resource, ie: You'll have a `Account::Create::Control` and `Account::Presenter`.

Each project will also need a `Server` class which mounts onto Rack. Look to each of the pieces documentation to learn more about what you can change.


Installing
==========

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "shogun", "~> 4.0"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself with:

    $ gem install shogun
